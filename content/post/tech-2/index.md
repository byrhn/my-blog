## What You Get (The Good)

### 1. Actual Noise Cancellation (ANC)
It has three modes: Transport, Indoor, and Outdoor.
* **Transport Mode:** Surprisingly good. It blocks out the low rumble of bus engines or airplane cabins effectively.
* **Voices:** It struggles a bit with high-pitched voices, but music drowns it out easily.

### 2. Insane Battery Life
* **40 Hours** with ANC on.
* **60 Hours** with ANC off.
* **Fast Charge:** A 5-minute charge gives you 4 hours of listening. This is a lifesaver.

### 3. The App is Fantastic
Most budget headphones have terrible apps. Anker’s app lets you customize the EQ (Equalizer) completely. You can make them sound bass-heavy or crisp vocal-focused.

## What You Sacrifice (The Bad)
*At this price point, these trade-offs are expected:*

* **Build Quality:** It’s plastic. It doesn't feel "luxury" like a metal Bose headset.
* **Sound Leakage:** If you blast music at 100% volume in a quiet library, people sitting next to you *will* hear it.
* **Bulky Case:** They fold, but the travel case is a bit thick for small bags.

## Verdict: Buy or Pass?

| ✅ BUY It If... | ❌ SKIP It If... |
| :--- | :--- |
| You want silence on your commute but don't want to spend hundreds. | You are an audiophile looking for studio-quality "flat" sound. |
| You listen to pop, hip-hop, or podcasts (great bass). | You need the absolute best microphone for business calls. |
| You hate charging your devices every day. | You want premium metal materials. |

### Final Thought
After testing these, the main question isn't "Are they good?", but rather **"Why did I spend so much money on other brands before?"**

If brand prestige isn't critical for you, this is the smartest investment in audio right now.
