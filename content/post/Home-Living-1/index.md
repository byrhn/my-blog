## The Problem: Ugly Stains
You spilled coffee on the rug, or your pet had an "accident" on the sofa. You can't put a sofa in the washing machine.
**The Solution:** The Bissell Little Green Portable Cleaner.

It sprays water, scrubs the fabric, and sucks the dirty water back up. We tested if it really saves your furniture.

## Where It Shines (The Good)

### 1. The "Coffee Test" (It Actually Works)
We didn't just trust the hype; we tested it.
* **Dried Coffee Stain (1 Year Old):** After two passes (spray, scrub, suck) with the Pet Stain formula, the stain was barely visible.
* **Fresh Orange Juice Spill:** It removed it completely in one go.
* **Result:** It saves you from hiring expensive professional cleaners.

### 2. The "Gross" Satisfaction
The dirty water tank is clear. Seeing the brown, murky water being sucked out of your "clean-looking" sofa is weirdly satisfying.

### 3. Detergent Hack (Save Money)
The machine comes with a sample bottle.
* **Pro Tip:** You don't always need the expensive brand formula. In an emergency, warm water mixed with a little standard carpet shampoo works great.

## The Frustrations & Solutions (The Bad)
*Honesty time with solutions:*

* **The Learning Curve (Don't Soak It!):** Beginners often leave the sofa too wet.
    * **The Trick:** Spray once, scrub, and then do **3 slow passes with suction only** (trigger released). This dries the fabric much faster.
* **Cleaning the Hose:** Cleaning the machine used to be annoying.
    * **The Hack:** Fill a clean bowl with water and suction it up with the machine. This "hydro-rinses" the hose instantly.
* **It is Loud:** It sounds like a full-sized vacuum. Don't use it while the baby is sleeping.
